I approach many problems with a human-centric focus from my background as a psychologist, and solve them using my honed programming skills. As a mid-westerner gone pacific-north-westerner and a research psychologist gone software developer, I have experience managing transitions and hitting the ground running.</span><br/></p>

                                    <p><span id="qualities"> Since I was young, I’ve been curious and creative; I often got in trouble for creating comics during class or for wandering off on my own “adventures” while traveling with my family. Needless to say I love being actively involved in anything I put my mind to. I’m an attentive listener who enjoys helping others solve problems, which is one reason I majored in psychology at Whitman College. Athletics and team sports have been a large part of my life. I love working, competing, and leading teams to a common goal. I was the captain of my college men’s volleyball team and my high school’s varsity tennis team. I still play rec-league sports, so if your company is looking for an extra player you know how to contact me!!</span><br/></p>

The Brand Experience conceptualizes, designs, and builds Corporate Experience Centers for companies such as Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Xerox, and Kaiser Permanente. My responsibilities included researching and analyzing prospective new companies and writing detailed reports on their strengths, weaknesses, and potential leveraging points for the CEO; interfacing and collaborating with fellow employees to help bring in new business, complete current projects, and build social media presence; and programming QR codes for clients’ exhibits.<br/> I also worked on Whitman’s Conference and Event Operation Team where I honed my customer service, project management and leadership skills. I was responsible for the scheduling, planning and execution of events and camps on campus. I interfaced with a variety of groups coming on campus, Whitman staff and security, and coordinated the events to make sure everything ran smoothly. I was the visitors’ first point of contact at the student union front desk and answered any questions and service related calls. Ultimately, I was given leadership responsibility for a team of crewmembers, who saw to the daily needs of our conference and event guests.</span><br/></p>

                                    <p><span id="program">During my final years in college, I realized that I loved the problem solving and data analysis aspects of research psychology, but wanted more creative challenges in a career. My software experience during college was primarily statistical software, such as R and SPSS. I found software development to be the perfect intersection between data, technical skill, and creativity. I started Code Fellows after graduating from Whitman. Code Fellows is a coding academy that is modeled after a four-year CS degree, but emphasizes technical skill and teaches individuals how to develop industry production-ready software and web applications.I graduated with a certificate in advanced software development in Python, which covers everything from back-end and full-stack development including subsequent frameworks like Django and Pyramid to algorithms, data structures, and machine learning. In addition to my advanced software development class, I also took foundation classes that provided me with extensive experience in JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML5.<br/><br/>If I could be doing anything right now: traveling or hiking.<br/>Favorite food: anything Asian and spicy… or Greek.<br/>Favorite artist: Mirumiyan. I was one credit away from being a visual art minor; I love printmaking, graphic design, and Photoshop.<br/></span></p>

I also love working with data and managing the unseen power of apps on the backend. I have extensive experience scraping data, accessing and creating APIs, and managing custom security protocols on apps. Doing all of this with a team that works hard and plays hard together is the future I want to create. I am currently working as a free-lance full-stack developer, but am hoping to work for a company that will help me, and allow me, to grow and hone my skills as a software developer and welcome and embrace the unique background I bring with me!</span></p>
